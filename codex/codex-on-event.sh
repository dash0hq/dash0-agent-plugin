# Bootstrap wrapper for the codex-on-event binary. Installed at a stable
# user-owned path by install-codex.sh and referenced by absolute path from the
# [[hooks.*]] entries in ~/.codex/config.toml, so each hook invocation runs:
#
#   stdin (JSON) → codex-on-event.sh → codex-on-event binary → OTLP
#
# Fail-open: any error before exec'ing the binary logs to stderr and exits 0 so
# a broken installer never breaks the user's Codex session. `set -e` is
# deliberately absent; fail_open does that job.

#   2. PLUGIN_DATA        — Codex sets this to the plugin's data dir when this
#                           script runs as an installed marketplace plugin, so
#                           the cache stays inside the plugin's own state.
#   3. ~/.local/state/…   — the installer (config.toml) path.
